libml: Machine learning library in C

This project is a demonstration of machine learning algorithms in C, and of bash-based testing infrastructure for a C project.

The project currently implements a KNN K Nearest Neighbors classifier and tests it on the Iris Dataset.
Future plans include implementing additional ML algorithms, implementing parallism/gpu uage, and testing on larger datasets.
